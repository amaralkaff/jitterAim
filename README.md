# Anti-Recoil Simulation Script (Jitter Aim)

## Introduction
This Python script is designed to simulate anti-recoil mechanics in desktop applications for educational and simulation purposes only. It utilizes the `win32api` to programmatically control mouse movements, offering an adjustable and toggle-able anti-recoil system directly from the keyboard.

## Features
- **Toggle anti-recoil on and off** using a specific key.
- **Adjustable recoil patterns** allow for custom settings.
- **Lightweight and easy to run** on Windows.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that **Python 3.x** is installed on your Windows machine. You can download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository** (if Git is installed) or download the ZIP file:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anti-recoil-script.git
   cd anti-recoil-script
   ```
2. **Install the required dependencies** using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the script, follow these steps:
1. Open your command prompt as administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Execute the script by running:
   ```bash
   python anti_recoil.py
   ```
4. Use the designated toggle key ('6' by default) to turn the anti-recoil functionality on and off while the script is running.

## Configuration
- **Toggle Key**: The default toggle key is '6' or '->' arrow. Change the value of `flat_toggle` in the script to use a different key.
