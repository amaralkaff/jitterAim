# Anti-Recoil Script

## Introduction
This Python script is designed to simulate anti-recoil mechanics in desktop applications for educational and simulation purposes only. It uses the `win32api` to programmatically control mouse movements and simulate different recoil patterns.

## Features
- Toggle anti-recoil on and off using a specific key.
- Adjustable recoil patterns.
- Lightweight and easy to run on Windows.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your Windows machine.
- `pywin32` and `keyboard` libraries installed.

### Steps
1. Ensure that Python and PIP are installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pywin32 keyboard
   ```
3. Download the script from the repository or clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
4. Navigate to the script directory.

## Usage
To run the script, follow these steps:
1. Open your command prompt as administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Use the designated toggle key ('6' by default) to turn the anti-recoil functionality on and off while the script is running.

## Configuration
- **Toggle Key**: The default toggle key is '6'. Change the value of `flat_toggle` in the script to use a different key.
