Creating a README file for your simulation script is an excellent way to document its functionality, usage, and any other important information. Here's a template README.md you can use for your anti-recoil script. This template provides a basic structure, including sections like Introduction, Installation, Usage, and Disclaimer, which are essential for clarity and responsible usage.

# Anti-Recoil Script

## Introduction
This Python script is designed to simulate anti-recoil mechanics in desktop applications for educational and simulation purposes only. It uses the `win32api` to programmatically control mouse movements and simulate different recoil patterns.

## Features
- Toggle anti-recoil on and off using a specific key.
- Adjustable recoil patterns.
- Lightweight and easy to run on Windows.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your Windows machine.
- `pywin32` and `keyboard` libraries installed.

### Steps
1. Ensure that Python and PIP are installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pywin32 keyboard
   ```
3. Download the script from the repository or clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
4. Navigate to the script directory.

## Usage
To run the script, follow these steps:
1. Open your command prompt as administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python anti_recoil.py
   ```
4. Use the designated toggle key ('6' by default) to turn the anti-recoil functionality on and off while the script is running.

## Configuration
- **Toggle Key**: The default toggle key is '6'. Change the value of `flat_toggle` in the script to use a different key.

## Disclaimer
This script is provided for educational and simulation purposes only. It is not intended for use in software environments or against services where such scripts are prohibited by terms of service or other rules. It is the end user's responsibility to ensure that their use of this script complies with all applicable laws and regulations.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the script or adapt it for different uses are welcome. Please ensure that all contributions adhere to the existing code standards and are documented appropriately.
